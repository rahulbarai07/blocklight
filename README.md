Blocklight — Intraday Session Probability Study

This repository contains a personal research project exploring how early intraday session behavior and daily range regimes relate to later-session outcomes in crypto markets.

The focus is on distributional behavior (probability, expected value, sample size), not prediction or execution.

What this project does

The trading day is divided into four 6-hour sessions (S1–S4).

Using historical data, the project examines:

How S1–S2 direction combinations relate to Session 3 outcomes

How S1–S3 direction paths relate to Session 4 outcomes

How these relationships change under different daily range regimes (Low / Normal / High)

All probabilities and expectancy metrics are computed offline and displayed read-only in the app.
